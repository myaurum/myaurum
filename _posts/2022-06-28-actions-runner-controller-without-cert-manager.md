## Overview

[actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller) is a great way to set up self-scaling GitHub runners in a Kubernetes cluster. This allows teams to scale up their self-hosted runners as more jobs are queued throughout the day and scale down at night when there are fewer jobs running. There is a lot of documentation to digest in the repository, but for the most part, it's relatively easy to get started with some basic scaling. The only prerequisite (other than having access to the Kubernetes cluster and administrative access to GitHub repo or organization) is [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/). 

However, sometimes organizations have their own certificate requirements, and prefer to manage their own certificates vs. letting a tool like cert-manager manage them. This is where the [current documentation is lacking and unclear](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller#using-without-cert-manager). Other people have asked the [same question](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller/issues?q=is%3Aissue+in%3Atitle+without+cert-manager+), as well as my most recent customer, and we were able to figure it out so I'll document it here!

## Configuring without cert-manager

I'm going to be creating self-signed certificates, but you could imagine this working with certificates provided to you from the security team. If creating your own certificates, you will need `openssl` installed and callable via the command line.

1\. Create RSA keys for CA cert and Server cert - this will output `ca.key`{: .filepath} and `server.key`{: .filepath}

```bash
openssl genrsa -out ca.key 4096
openssl genrsa -out server.key 4096
```

2\. Create a CA configuration file (`ca.conf`{: .filepath}) - the `basicConstraints` and `keyUsage` sections are required in order for the CA to be able to sign certificates

```config
basicConstraints = CA:TRUE
keyUsage = cRLSign, keyCertSign
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
prompt = no
[req_distinguished_name]
C = US
ST = SomeState
L = SomeCity
O = SomeOrg
emailAddress = your@email.com
CN = actionrunners.yourorg.com
```
{: file='ca.conf'}

3\. Create the CA certificate with the `ca.conf`{: .filepath} file - this will output `ca.crt`{: .filepath}

```bash
openssl req -x509 -new -sha512 -nodes -key ./ca.key -days 7307 -out ./ca.crt -config ./ca.conf
```
{: .nolineno}

4\. Optionally validate that the CA certificate created successfully

```bash
openssl x509 -noout -text -in ./ca.crt
```
{: .nolineno}

5\. Create your Server certificate config file - ie `server.conf`{: .filepath}

- All 3 SANs (`alt_names`) are needed
- For the 3rd `alt_name`, the `actions-runner-system` is the namespace - if you are installing into a different namespace, replace `actions-runner-system` with the namespace you are installing to (ie: `default`)

```text
[req]
default_bits = 4096
prompt = no
default_md = sha256
x509_extensions = v3_req
distinguished_name = dn

[dn]
C = US
ST = SomeState
L = SomeCity
O = SomeOrg
emailAddress = your@email.com
CN = actionrunners.yourorg.com

[v3_req]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = webhook-service.actions-runner-system.svc
DNS.2 = webhook-service.actions-runner-system.svc.cluster.local
DNS.3 = actions-runner-controller-webhook.actions-runner-system.svc
```
{: file='server.conf'}

6\. Create the server Certificate Signing Request (csr) - this will outut `server.csr`{: .filepath}

```bash
openssl req -new -key ./server.key -out ./server.csr -config ./server.conf
```
{: .nolineno}

7\. Create your Server certificate - this will output `server.crt`{: .filepath}

```bash
openssl x509 -req -in ./server.csr -CA ./ca.crt -CAkey ./ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial -out ./server.crt -days 10000 \
  -extensions v3_req -extfile ./server.conf
```
{: .nolineno}

8\. Optionally inspect your Server cert to make sure it has the Subject Alternate Names (SANs, aka the `alt_names` from step #5)

```bash
openssl x509 -noout -text -in ./server.crt
```
{: .nolineno}

9\. Base64 the CA cert and copy to clipboard (`pbcopy` is a macOS command, if running elsewhere just echo `$CA_BUNDLE` and copy)

```bash
CA_BUNDLE=$(cat ca.crt | base64)
echo $CA_BUNDLE | pbcopy
```

10\. Set the `admissionWebHooks.caBundle` value in the `values.yaml`{: .filepath} file to the base64 value of the CA cert - you may have to remove the extra `{}` under `admissionWebHooks`

```yaml
admissionWebHooks:
  # {} # need to remove this
  caBundle: "Ci0tL..."
```

11\. In the `values.yaml`{: .filepath} file, ensure `certManagerEnabled` is set to false

```yaml
certManagerEnabled: false
```

12\. Create your certificate secrets using `kubectl` - both of these are needed

```bash
kubectl create secret tls webhook-server-cert -n actions-runner-system \
  --cert=./server.crt  --key=./server.key
kubectl create secret tls actions-runner-controller-serving-cert -n actions-runner-system \
  --cert=./server.crt  --key=./server.key
```

13\. Run the `helm upgrade` command to install the controller

```bash
helm upgrade --install --namespace actions-runner-system --create-namespace \ 
  --wait actions-runner-controller actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller \
  --values ./values.yaml
```

Note: Make sure to you have ran the `helm repo add` [command already](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller#installation)

14\. Ensure that your `actions-runner-controller` pod in the `actions-runner-system` namespace has started - if it fails, describe the pod and check the events

15\. Deploy your runner configuration - [my example](https://gist.github.com/joshjohanning/4c4ccd3998d81552be940b07649d609a) with org runners and metric-based scaling

```bash
kubectl apply -f runner.yaml --namespace default
```

16\. Ensure that your runner pods have started (describe them if not); check GitHub to see if your runner(s) show there also

Here's me running [`k9s`](https://k9scli.io/) to visualize the pods and ensure they are running:
![Using k9s to ensure pods are running](pods.png){: .shadow }
_The controller running in the actions-runner-system namespace; the runner pods running in the default namespace_

Corresponding runners show up as org runners in GitHub:

_Runners with the same name as the pod name show up as org runners in GitHub_

## Summary

[actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions-runner-controller/actions-runner-controller) is great, but sometimes you need some good trial-and-error to do things off the beaten path. Luckily, we were able to figure out how to configure the controller without using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) by interpreting the errors we saw when describing the failing pods.

As an enhancement, I could see you wanting a separate certificate for the `actions-runner-controller-serving-cert` and `webhook-server-cert` in step #12 - but I'll leave further certificate optimizations to the certificate pros.

Feel free to ask any questions or share any enhancements!
