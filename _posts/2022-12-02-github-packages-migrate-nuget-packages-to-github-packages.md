## Overview

To complete my NuGet Package migration series, I wanted to demonstrate how one could migrate NuGet packages to GitHub Package. The other system we are migrating from (whether it be Azure Artifacts, Artifactory, etc.) doesn't so much matter, as long as we are able to download/access the `.nupkg`{: .filepath} files on a system so that we can re-push to GitHub Packages.

## The script

The repo and docs can be found here: 
- **[https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-packages-migrate-nuget-packages-to-github-packages](https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-packages-migrate-nuget-packages-to-github-packages)**

I decided to store the script in a separate GitHub repo than my [github-misc-scripts](/posts/github-misc-scripts/) repo to better facilitate any feedback/suggestions/improvements I might get - feel free to submit a PR if you can improve things ðŸš€!

## Update the mappings file

Your `csv`{: .filepath} file should look something like this:

```
Package,Target GitHub Repo
./mypkg.11.0.1.nupkg,my-org/my-repo
./mypkg.11.0.2.nupkg,my-org/my-repo

```
{: file='packages.csv'}

> Leave a trailing space at the end of the `csv`{: .filepath} file.
{: .prompt-info }

## Running the script

There are two scripts that need to be ran:

1. Generate the list of packages to migrate in the current directory and creating a mappings `csv`{: .filepath} file
  - We then need to fill out the GitHub repository mapping for each package in the form of `owner/repo`
1. Migrate the packages to GitHub Packages

### Prerequisites

But first, the prequisites:

1. [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) installed:
   ```bash
   dotnet tool install gpr -g
   ```
   {: .nolineno}
4. Can use this one-liner to find the absolute path for [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) for the `<path-to-gpr>` parameter: 
   ```bash
   find / -wholename "*tools/gpr" 2> /dev/null
   ```
   {: .nolineno}
3. `<pat>` must have `write:packages` scope

We are passing [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) in as a parameter explicitly because sometimes [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) is aliased to `git pull --rebase` and that's not what we want here.

### Generate the Mappings File

This finds all `.nupkg`{: .filepath} files in the current directory and generates a mappings `csv`{: .filepath} file.

```bash
./generate-nuget-package-mappings.sh \
  . \
  > <mappings-file>
```

> Use this one-liner to copy all `.nupkg`{: .filepath} files to a directory before `./generate-nuget-package-mappings.sh`{: .filepath}: 
> ```bash
> find / -name "*.nupkg" -exec cp "{}" ./  \;
> ```
> {: .nolineno}
{: .prompt-tip }

Afterwards, you need to edit the `csv`{: .filepath} file to add the target GitHub repo reference, in the form of `owner/repo`.

> Leave a trailing space at the end of the `csv`{: .filepath} file.
{: .prompt-info }

### Migrate the Packages

This pushes the packages to the mapped GitHub repo:

```bash
./migrate-nuget-packages-to-github.sh \
  <mappings-file> \
  <pat> \
  <path-to-gpr>
```

### Complete Example

An example of this in practice:

```bash
# 1. generate mappings file
./generate-nuget-package-mappings.sh \
  . \
  > packages.csv

# 2. edit the mappings file to add the GitHub repo in the form of `owner/repo`

# 3. push packages
./migrate-nuget-packages-between-orgs.sh \
  packages.csv \
  ghp_xyz \
  /home/codespace/.dotnet/tools/gpr
```

## Notes

- The script uses [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) to re-push the packages to the target org
  + I initially tried writing this with [`dotnet nuget push`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-push), but that doesn't seem to work since the package's `<RepositoryUrl>` element would still be referencing the original repository. See error:

    ```
    dotnet nuget push \
      -s github \
      -k ghp_pat \
      NUnit3.DotNetNew.Template_1.7.1.nupkg

    Pushing NUnit3.DotNetNew.Template_1.7.1.nupkg to 'https://nuget.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org-packages-migrated'...
      PUT https://nuget.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org-packages-migrated/
    warn : Source owner 'joshjohanning-org-packages-migrated' does not match repo owner 'joshjohanning-org-packages' in repository element.
      BadRequest https://nuget.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org-packages-migrated/ 180ms
    error: Response status code does not indicate success: 400 (Bad Request).
    ```
    {: file='\'dotnet nuget push\' error'}

  + [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) works because it rewrites the `<repository url="..." />` element in the `.nuspec`{: .filepath} file in the `.nupkg`{: .filepath} before pushing
  + There is an item on [GitHub's roadmap](https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/589) to support pushing packages directly to an organization; this should allow [`dotnet nuget push`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-push) to work instead of [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr)
    - [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) still might be preferred since you would have to tie the NuGet package to the repository manually post-migration
    - For [`dotnet nuget push`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-nuget-push) to work, you will have to add the feed first using this command:
      ```bash
      dotnet nuget add source \
        --username my-github-username \
        --password "ghp_pat" \
        --store-password-in-clear-text \
        --name github \
        "https://nuget.pkg.github.com/OWNER/index.json"
      ```
      {: .nolineno}

## Improvement Ideas

* [ ] Add a source folder input instead of relying on current directory for `./generate-nuget-package-mappings.sh`{: .filepath} 
* [ ] Dynamically determine out where [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) is installed instead of passing in a parameter (right now we are passing the [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) path in as a parameter explicitly because sometimes [`gpr`](https://github.com/jcansdale/gpr) is aliased to `git pull --rebase`)
