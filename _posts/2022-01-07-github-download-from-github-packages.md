## Overview

We had a team that wanted to push to GitHub packages, which is relatively easily enough to do and is well [documented](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry). However, they had a subsequent job that was building a Docker image where that dependency (the `.jar` or `.war` file) was needed.

There are a couple of different ways you could think about this.

1. Maybe the `docker build` step should occur in the same job as the `mvn build` step so that it has access to the same binary outputs
2. Perhaps instead of GitHub Packages we create a Release on the repository - we can use an [Action](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release) to do this and an [API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/releases#get-a-release-asset) to download the release
3. If we really just want to download the package binary from GitHub Packages...that should be simple enough, right?

## Just use the Packages API, right?

The [API for GitHUb Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/packages) says:

> With the GitHub Packages API, you can **manage** packages for your GitHub repositories and organizations.

Keyword: **manage**, such as listing or deleting packages. It doesn't really imply *downloading* or *retrieiving package assets* like the [Release API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/releases#get-a-release-asset) has.

Okay, but can't we just go to the package in the UI and copy the download link?

Nope -- check the URL of one of the files in my repo:

> https://github-registry-files.githubusercontent.com/445574648/92585100-6fe8-11ec-8a00-38630c14852f?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWNJYAX4CSVEH53A%2F20220107%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220107T193611Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=96f4809aebb229ea01b80832c12e546810837194203927c39a31f2c875b177fd&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&actor_id=0&key_id=0&repo_id=445574648&response-content-disposition=filename%3Dherokupoc-1.0.0-202201071835.jar&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream

Pretty nasty huh? It looks to be a timed download URL.

After spending a few hours on this, there were a few ways I found to do this with various levels of monstrocities committed in finding. I'll start with the best / easiest and work my way down. 

## Mysteriously hidden URL to CURL

In hindsight, it's so simple (at least for Maven), yet it's not documented anywhere! I was trying to use the `mvn dependency:get/copy` cli and kept getting stuck on a `401 unauthorized` error message. In the logs, I saw the URL to the `.jar` file I was trying to download and decided to paste that into my browser. I received a username/password basic auth prompt, and I simply pasted in my PAT as a password and I was able to download that file.

Extrapulating to `curl`, this was how to replicate this in the command line:

{% raw %}
```bash
curl 'https://maven.pkg.github.com/<org>/<repo>/com/<group>/<artifact>/<version>/<file-name>.jar' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
  -L \
  -O
```

And because my biggest pet peave is when someone has this awesome blog post but then hides/obfuscates all the good stuff, here's my actual CURL command I used to download a file:

```bash
curl 'https://maven.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org/sherlock-heroku-poc-mvn-package/com/sherlock/herokupoc/1.0.0-202201071559/herokupoc-1.0.0-202201071559.jar' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" \
  -L \
  -O
```

The `-L` is important here as this tells `curl` to follow redirects. Without it, you'll get a '301 Moved Permanently' because it's trying to use use the expanded URL as mentioned above. If you added the `-v` option to the command, you would see a similar long URL that our `curl` follows the redirect to.

The `-O` downloads the file locally with the same name as in the URL.

## GraphQL Endpoint

You can also query against the [GraphQL Endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/graphql/reference/objects#package). It's not pretty, but here are my examples:

### Getting the latest download url

Use this GraphQL to get the latest package version download url:

```graphql
{
  repository(owner: "joshjohanning", name: "Wolfringo-github-packages") {
    packages(first: 10, packageType: NUGET, names: "Wolfringo.Commands") {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
          packageType
          versions(first: 100) {
            nodes {
              id
              version
              files(first: 10) {
                nodes {
                  name
                  url
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This is an example output of that query:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "repository": {
            "packages": {
                "edges": [
                    {
                        "node": {
                            "id": "P_kwDOGo5-nc4AEg_Z",
                            "name": "Wolfringo.Commands",
                            "packageType": "NUGET",
                            "versions": {
                                "nodes": [
                                    {
                                        "id": "PV_lADOGo5-nc4AEg_ZzgDrF3k",
                                        "version": "1.1.2",
                                        "files": {
                                            "nodes": [
                                                {
                                                    "name": "package.nupkg",
                                                    "url": "https://github-registry-files.githubusercontent.com/445546141/cb7fc980-6fc6-11ec-9aa4-02a12c9562b7?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAIWNJYAX4CSVEH53A%2F20220107%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20220107T195615Z&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Signature=5a15e3e70dc86e0485eb8b718374f142d6bdc477c5a99a27ddc7517121ca2818&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&actor_id=19912012&key_id=0&repo_id=445546141&response-content-disposition=filename%3Dpackage.nupkg&response-content-type=application%2Foctet-stream"
                                                }
                                            ]
                                        }
                                    }
                                ]
                            }
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

To retreive the URL you can `curl`, the `jq` is something like: 

```bash
jq -r '.data.repository.packages.edges[].node.versions.nodes[].files.nodes[].url'
```
{: .nolineno}

This is how you can run this GraphQL command via [`gh cli`](https://cli.github.com/) to output the download url:

```bash
gh api graphql -f packageType="NUGET" -f owner="joshjohanning-org" -f repo="Wolfringo-github-packages" -f packageName="Wolfringo.Core" -f query='
query ($packageType: PackageType!, $owner: String!, $repo: String!, $packageName: [String!]) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    packages(first: 10, packageType: $packageType, names: $packageName) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
          packageType
          versions(first: 100) {
            nodes {
              id
              version
              files(first: 10) {
                nodes {
                  name
                  url
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -q '.data.repository.packages.edges[].node.versions.nodes[].files.nodes[].url'
```

### Getting a specific version download url

Use this GraphQL to get a package's specific version download url:

```graphql
{
  repository(owner: "joshjohanning", name: "Wolfringo-github-packages") {
    packages(first: 10, packageType: NUGET, names: "Wolfringo.Commands") {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
          packageType
          version(version: "1.1.2") {
            id
            version
            files(first: 10) {
              nodes {
                name
                updatedAt
                size
                url
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Similar example with specific version, using [`gh cli`](https://cli.github.com/) again:

```bash
gh api graphql -f packageType="NUGET" -f owner="joshjohanning" -f repo="Wolfringo-github-packages" -f packageName="Wolfringo.Commands" -f packageVersion="1.1.2" -f query='
query ($packageType: PackageType!, $owner: String!, $repo: String!, $packageName: [String!], $packageVersion: String!) {
  repository(owner: $owner, name: $repo) {
    packages(first: 100, packageType: $packageType, names: $packageName) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          name
          packageType
          version(version: $packageVersion) {
            id
            version
            files(first: 10) {
              nodes {
                name
                updatedAt
                size
                url
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' -q '.data.repository.packages.edges[].node.version.files.nodes[].url'
```

## mvn install and mv

I was able to get something like this to work - see my GitHub Action job below:

```yml
  download-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: maven-settings-xml-action
      uses: whelk-io/maven-settings-xml-action@v20
      with:
        repositories: '[{ "id": "fix_world", "url": "https://maven.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org/sherlock-heroku-poc-mvn-package" }]'
        servers: '[{ "id": "fix_world", "username": "joshjohanning", "password": "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" }]'

    - name: View settings.xml
      run: cat ~/.m2/settings.xml 
      
    - name: Install with Maven
      run: mvn install -s ~/.m2/settings.xml
      
    # wildcard find and mv command to current directory
    - name: mv
      run: find /home/runner/.m2 -name "*herokupoc-1.*.jar" -exec mv {} . \;
```

## mvn cli - sort of

This is what we were originally trying to do, so thought I would throw it in here to spur other ideas for other languages. We were trying to use `mvn dependenct:get` to download the `.jar` file, but were ultimately uncessful for one reason or another.

This is the job we ended with:

```yml
  mvncli:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: maven-settings-xml-action
      uses: whelk-io/maven-settings-xml-action@v20
      with:
        repositories: '[{ "id": "fix_world", "url": "https://maven.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org/sherlock-heroku-poc-mvn-package" }]'
        servers: '[{ "id": "fix_world", "username": "joshjohanning", "password": "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" }]'
    - name: download
      run: | 
        mvn dependency:get \
          -DgroupId=com.sherlock \
          -DartifactId=herokupoc \
           -Dversion=1.0.0-202201071835 \
          -Dpackaging=jar \
          -Dclassifier=sources \
          -DremoteRepositories=central::default::https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2,fix_world::::https://maven.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org/sherlock-heroku-poc-mvn-package
```

But gives us an authentication error: 

> Error:  Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-dependency-plugin:3.1.1:get (default-cli) on project herokupoc: Couldn't download artifact: org.eclipse.aether.resolution.DependencyResolutionException: Could not transfer artifact com.sherlock:herokupoc:jar:sources:1.0.0-202201071835 from/to fix_world (https://maven.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org/sherlock-heroku-poc-mvn-package): authentication failed for **https://maven.pkg.github.com/joshjohanning-org/sherlock-heroku-poc-mvn-package/com/sherlock/herokupoc/1.0.0-202201071835/herokupoc-1.0.0-202201071835-sources.jar**, status: 401 Unauthorized -> [Help 1]

But this was still useful though as this what led me to just try to [`curl` that `.jar` file URL](#mysteriously-hidden-url-to-curl) successfully :). 

## Wrap-up

Hopefully this either helped you download a file from GitHub Packages, gives you ideas for other languages, or maybe my struggles convince you to *just use a Release in GitHub*.

I should mention that for some of these you might need to tweak your [GITHUB_TOKEN settings](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-for-your-repository) to grant it more permissions.

Let me know what I've missed or if you have any other ideas!
