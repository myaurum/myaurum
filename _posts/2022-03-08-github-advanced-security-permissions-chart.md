## Overview

I have several [posts discussing GitHub Advanced Security](/tags/github-advanced-security/), but practically a question that I get often is: _"Who can access the alerts on each repository?"_

I hope to solve that with this permissions / access requirements chart!

## Access requirements for security features

This chart is loosely based on [the one from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-roles-for-an-organization), with a few additions, modifications, and clarifications.

Notes:

- [1] **Read** and **Triage** have the same rights for security features
- [2] **Write** and **Maintain** have the same rights for security features
- [3] Repository **writers** and **maintainers** can only see secret alert information for their own commits
- [4] Now that the [org-level security overview is available to all Enterprise users](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-08-08-security-overview-is-now-available-to-all-github-enterprise-users/), org members can see consolidated results of repositories that they can see alerts for (e.g., **write** for CodeQL, **admin** for Dependabot and secrets, etc.)
- [5] In the [enterprise-level security overview](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/security-overview/about-the-security-overview) level, one would see organizations where they are added as an **org owner** or **security manager** - **enterprise owners** must [join an organization as an owner](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/user-management/managing-organizations-in-your-enterprise/managing-your-role-in-an-organization-owned-by-your-enterprise) to see alerts
- [6] **Security managers** get read-only access to every repository in the organization
- This chart primarily focuses on **GitHub Enterprise Cloud**, but note that Advanced Security is available for GitHub Enterprise Server [3.0 or higher](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security). There may be slight differences in the features available for GitHub Enterprise Server based on the version

## Granting access to security alerts

Security alerts for a repository are visible to people with admin access to the repository and, when the repository is owned by an organization, organization owners. You can also [give additional teams and people access to the alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository#granting-access-to-security-alerts).

When [adding users to be able to view security alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/github/administering-a-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository#granting-access-to-security-alerts), there is a bit of text that explains (emphasis mine): 

> Admins, users, and teams in the list below have permission to **view and manage code scanning, Dependabot, or secret scanning alerts**. These users may be notified when a new vulnerability is found in one of this repository's dependencies and when a secret or key is checked in. They will also see additional details when viewing Dependabot security updates. Individuals can manage how they receive these alerts in their [notification settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications).

Note: Organization owners and repository administrators can only grant access to view security alerts, such as secret scanning alerts, to people or teams who have **write** access to the repo.

## Custom Repository Roles

Organization administrators can create [Custom Repository Roles](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-custom-repository-roles-for-an-organization) to customize and fine-tune different permission sets that repository administrators can grant. For example, I want to create a role that allows users to have Write access AND be able to view/dismiss Dependabot Alerts:

![Custom Repository Roles](custom-roles.png){: .shadow }
_Custom repository roles - creating a custom role to allow viewing/managing of Dependabot alerts_

Note that there is currently a maximum of 3 custom roles that can be created in the organization.
