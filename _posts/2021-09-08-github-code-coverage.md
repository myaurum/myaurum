## Overview

This is a follow-up to my previous post: [The Easiest Way to Generate and Publish .NET Code Coverage in Azure DevOps](/posts/azure-devops-code-coverage/)

I was familiar with adding Code Coverage to my pipelines in Azure DevOps and having a Code Coverage tab appear on the pipeline summary page, but I wasn't sure what was available for GitHub Actions. With GitHub Actions really starting to pick up steam, especially with recent additions such as [Composite Actions](https://www.colinsalmcorner.com/github-composite-actions/), I thought now would be a great time to explore.

## Adding Code Coverage to Pull Request

I found this GitHub Action in the marketplace - [Code Coverage Summary](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/code-coverage-summary). There might be others, but this one seemed simple and had the functionality I was looking for.

This post assumes you are using the `coverlet.collector` [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/coverlet.collector/). For a refresher, see the "[the better way](https://josh-ops.com/posts/azure-devops-code-coverage/#the-better-way)" section of my previous post.

Here's the relevant part of my GitHub Actions [workflow file](https://github.com/joshjohanning/PrimeService-unit-testing-using-dotnet-test/blob/main/.github/workflows/dotnet.yml):

```yml
    # Add coverlet.collector nuget package to test project - 'dotnet add <TestProject.cspoj> package coverlet
    - name: Test
      run: dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --logger trx --results-directory coverage
      
    - name: Copy Coverage to Predictable Location
      run: cp coverage/*/coverage.cobertura.xml coverage/coverage.cobertura.xml

    - name: Code Coverage Summary Report
      uses: irongut/CodeCoverageSummary@v1.3.0
      with:
        filename: coverage/coverage.cobertura.xml
        badge: true
        format: 'markdown'
        output: 'both'

    - name: Add Coverage PR Comment
      uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
      if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
      with:
        recreate: true
        path: code-coverage-results.md

    - name: Write to Job Summary
      run: cat code-coverage-results.md >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```
{: file='.github/workflows/dotnet.yml'}

Note the test command here that we are using to generate the Cobertura code coverage summary file:

```bash
dotnet test --no-build --verbosity normal --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --logger trx
```
{: .nolineno}

We have to use a copy command to copy the `coverage.cobertura.xml`{: .filepath} to a known location - the marketplace action we are using doesn't seem to support wildcards and Coverlet uses a random guid folder path.

```bash
cp coverage/*/coverage.cobertura.xml coverage/coverage.cobertura.xml
```
{: .nolineno}

The next action is the [Code Coverage Summary Report](https://github.com/irongut/CodeCoverageSummary) action: 

> CodeCoverageSummary Inputs:
> * filename: **coverage/coverage.cobertura.xml**
> * badge: **true** &#124; false
> * format: **markdown** &#124; text
> * output: console &#124; file &#124; **both**

```yml
    - name: Code Coverage Summary Report
      uses: irongut/CodeCoverageSummary@v1.3.0
      with:
        filename: coverage/coverage.cobertura.xml
        badge: true
        format: 'markdown'
        output: 'both'
```

This would be enough to show the code coverage in the action run: 
![github action code coverage report](/assets/screenshots/2021-09-08-github-code-coverage/github-action-code-coverage.png){: .shadow }
_Code Coverage Summary Report in the Action run logs_

However, the fun doesn't stop there. How useful would it be to post this to the PR so it's nice and easy for reviewers? Well, the next [action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/sticky-pull-request-comment) shows a simple way we can add (and sticky) a PR comment with our code coverage report:

```yml
    - name: Add Coverage PR Comment
      uses: marocchino/sticky-pull-request-comment@v2
      if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
      with:
        recreate: true
        path: code-coverage-results.md
```

Perfect - nothing for us to configure here, either. On the pull request, this comment is added: 

![github action pull request](/assets/screenshots/2021-09-08-github-code-coverage/github-action-pr.png){: .shadow }
_Code Coverage Summary Report added as a pinned comment to the Pull Request_

This is also demonstrated on my [pull request here](https://github.com/joshjohanning/PrimeService-unit-testing-using-dotnet-test/pull/2). 

You'll notice the badge along with the markdown table summarizing the code coverage report.

The nice thing with this action is that if a new commit is pushed to the PR triggering a new action run, the comment will be deleted/re-added with the updated code coverage summary.

## Adding Code Coverage to Job Summary

I think this is looking great, but what if we don't happen to create a pull request, how can we neatly see our code coverage report? Well, since May 9, 2022 (and GitHub Enterprise Server >= 3.6.0) we can use the [Job Summary](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-09-github-actions-enhance-your-actions-with-job-summaries/)! 

Since the CodeCoverageSummary action is already generating the markdown for us, all we have to do is append it to the [`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-job-summary) environment variable. Add in the following run command to the end of the job:

```yml
    - name: Write to Job Summary
      run: cat code-coverage-results.md >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

Now, it publishes to the job summary page right next to the action run logs! See the screenshot below:

![Job Summary in GitHub Actions](/assets/screenshots/2021-09-08-github-code-coverage/github-action-code-coverage-job-summary.png){: .shadow }
_Code Coverage Summary Report added to the job summary_

## ReportGenerator?

The above works well if you have a single test project, but if you have more than one, see the "[Why not ReportGenerator?](https://josh-ops.com/posts/azure-devops-code-coverage/#why-not-reportgenerator) section in my previous post for the commands and rationale.

The equivalent in GitHub Actions would be:

```yml
    - name: Create code coverage report
      run: |
        dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool
        reportgenerator -reports:$(Agent.WorkFolder)/**/coverage.cobertura.xml -targetdir:$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/CodeCoverage -reporttypes:'Cobertura'
```

Then, since you have a single Cobertura report, you can point the file that is outputted to the action.

> CodeCoverageSummary [v1.3.0](https://github.com/irongut/CodeCoverageSummary/releases/tag/v1.3.0) now supports glob pattern matching for multiple coverage files. Now, you don't even have to use the example above to combine the code coverage report before processing!
{: .prompt-tip }

## Conclusion

Maybe not _as pretty_ as the Cobertura report shown in Azure DevOps, but just as effective! Certainly the addition of [job summaries](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-09-github-actions-enhance-your-actions-with-job-summaries/) makes this a better experience.

And hey, now on the GitHub Pull Request, you get to actually see the code coverage report before the *[end of the entire pipeline run](https://josh-ops.com/posts/azure-devops-code-coverage/#code-coverage-tab-not-showing-up)* like in Azure DevOps ðŸ˜€.
