## Overview

I have a large Postman workspace for all my API calls, but itâ€™s sometimes hard to share an example of an API or script with someone. Thus, I decided to create a repo that consolidates my random GitHub scripts into one central spot. Now, I can simply send a link!

Here's the repo: [joshjohanning/github-misc-scripts](https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-misc-scripts)

## Layout

I have them categorized by type:

* [api](https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-misc-scripts/tree/main/api)
* [gh-cli](https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-misc-scripts/tree/main/gh-cli)
* [graphql](https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-misc-scripts/tree/main/graphql)
* [scripts](https://github.com/joshjohanning/github-misc-scripts/tree/main/scripts)

I have readme's in each of the folders with a brief description of the enclosed scripts.

## Script Examples
